# NLP Project

This is our code for the 6.864 final project.

The `jose` directory contains the models and implementation for Part 1, including the CNN and LSTM embeddings. To run, use `main.py` with the arguments described in the file for the domain adaptation model, and `direct_transfer_main` for the direct transfer model.


The `akshay` directory contains the models and implementation for Part 2, including the domain transfer model and direct transfer model logic. To run, use `main.py` with the arguments described in the file for the domain adaptation model, and `direct_transfer_main` for the direct transfer model.
